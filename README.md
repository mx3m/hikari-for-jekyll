# hikari

Hikari is an open-source [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme perfect for bloggers and developers who want the best of both worlds: sharing snippets and stories/pictures of their latest vacation in Tokyo (that's just for the example, you may want to go to Kyoto too). 

Hikari is extremely lightweight, responsive and to some extent, beautiful.

### Roadmap

Hikari is currently WIP. *Last update - Feb 4th, 2014.*

- Add images caption
- Allow users to change their bio/profile and footer text via markdown (or maybe not)
- Stop giving silly, unrelated japanese names to every single project I do

### Development

- `master` for development and pull requests.
- `gh-pages` for the demo page; don't bother.
