Having taste won't make anyone a designer, ever. Designing is not about having taste. Look at [Reddit](www.reddit.com), great design, terrible taste. Well, as far as **I** am concerned. 

See what I did there? Taste is too subjective to be attached to design anyways. What I consider to be good-looking, you might find it boring or pretentious. Good design on the other hand is unanimous. 

Having taste can even be a burden because, during early stages of one's career, we find ourselves rushing into visuals before even thinking about a design solution (red flag, right there). 

Thing is, I visualise stuff. Discuss an idea with me, I'll always try to visualise it. 

>Conceptualising is hard because it requires to shut down our graphic imagination and stay focused on the big picture. Principles and data over layout and typeface.

As a matter of fact, we all know people with excellent taste but that are not, nor couldn't be designers. My fiancee has great taste but she still struggles to understand how I can still be up at 3AM because I haven't cracked the Information Architecture of a website. 

Taste is what I don't like about [Dribbble](www.dribbble.com) because the front page is mainly populated with the same designers who got excellent, yet conformist, taste. Taste is what made them famous, but still, are they good designers? Some are, I believe. But how can we be sure when almost none of them is ever posting wireframes or sketches?

Dribbble is a great place but a place that is exclusively celebrating taste, not design. 

This is one of the thing I want to avoid in 2014. I have a lifetime to refine my visual taste but merely a few years to prove myself as someone who can solve problems through design. *Design isn't about how it looks?* Everyone says it, who's really doing it?
