# hikari

Hikari is an open-source [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme perfect for bloggers and developers who want the best of both worlds: sharing snippets and stories/pictures of their latest vacation in Tokyo (that's just for the example, you may want to go to Kyoto too). 

The theme is packed with jQuery (note to myself of the future: replace with vanilla JS) to make your and my life easier. 

Hikari is lightweight, responsive and to some extent, beautiful.

### Roadmap

Hikari is currently WIP. 

- Remove jQuery and only use vanilla javascript for the 2/3 events which need it
- Fix bug / three lines icon on touch devices
- Allow users to change their bio/profile and footer text via markdown (or maybe not)
- Learn how to code properly 
- Stop giving silly, unrelated japanese names to every single project I do

### Development

- `master` for development and pull requests.
- `gh-pages` for the demo page; don't bother.
